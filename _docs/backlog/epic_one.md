# Optimizing Inter-agent Communication

All right, so...

Alright, we are optimizing inter-agent communication using personality-mediated artificial intelligence.

Given an MBTI profile of INTJ, the backdrop I'm creating generated is an agent that announces its presence and then asks how to proceed.

And what it's assigned, profile, ion, or EN-TJ. It introduces itself, "Hello. I am tasked with acquiring the host system of information. Let's get started efficiently. What's the best way to proceed?"
