## Merged Backlog: Ansible Collection for AI/NLP Systems Development

This backlog combines the initial suggestions with your detailed breakdown of Ansible roles and playbooks, focusing on both Docker and KVM deployments.

**Epics:**

1.  **Core Infrastructure and Virtualization**
2.  **AI/NLP Tools and Services**
    - Sub-Epic: No-Code Evaluation Platform
3.  **Deployment and Orchestration**
4.  **Observability and Logging**
5.  **Development and Evaluation Environment**
6.  **Backup, Recovery, and Scalability**
7.  **CI/CD and Automation**
8.  **Documentation, Maintenance, and Community**

**User Stories:**

**Epic 1: Core Infrastructure and Virtualization**

- **\[1. Core Infrastructure Setup\]**
  - As a sysadmin, I want to use Ansible to configure the base system, network, firewall, and SSH access securely.
- **\[2. Virtualization and Containerization\]**
  - As a DevOps engineer, I want to choose between KVM and Docker for deploying the AI/NLP environment based on my needs.
  - As a developer, I want Ansible to handle the installation and configuration of either KVM or Docker.
- **\[9. KVM-specific Tasks\]**
  - As a sysadmin, I want to use Ansible to provision, manage snapshots, and configure networks for KVM virtual machines.
- **\[10. Docker-specific Tasks\]**
  - As a developer, I want Ansible to build, manage, and configure Docker images, containers, networks, and volumes.

**Epic 2: AI/NLP Tools and Services**

- **\[3. Database and Storage\]**
  - As a developer, I want Ansible to install and configure Postgres/PGvector, Redis, and ChromaDB for my AI/NLP projects.
- **\[4. AI and ML Tools\]**
  - As a data scientist, I want to easily deploy Flowise, Dify.ai, Ollama, LocalAI, and customized SillyTavern using Ansible roles.
- **\[7. Evaluation Frameworks\]**
  - As an AI researcher, I want to set up containers for AI evaluation frameworks using Ansible.

  - Sub-Epic: No-Code Evaluation Platform

    - \[High Priority\] As a subject-matter expert, I want to use a no-code platform to easily design and develop evaluation workflows for AI agents.
    - \[High Priority\] As a developer, I want to integrate "Nano Bots" - lightweight, shareable AI bots configurable with YAML - into the platform.
    - \[High Priority\] As a developer, I need Redis-based state management to enable stateful interactions between different stages of the evaluation workflow.
    - \[High Priority\] As a data scientist, I need a customizable NLP processing pipeline with tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and morphology analysis for evaluating agent responses.
    - \[High Priority\] As a developer, I need automatic evaluation tools and a feedback loop mechanism to dynamically adjust agent behavior based on human input.

**Epic 3: Deployment and Orchestration**

- **\[8. Deployment Strategies\]**
  - As a DevOps engineer, I want to use Ansible playbooks for zero-downtime deployments, blue-green deployments, and rolling updates.
- **\[11. Integration and Orchestration\]**
  - As a developer, I want a master playbook to deploy the entire AI/NLP environment with a menu-driven role selection.
  - As a sysadmin, I need Ansible to handle environment-specific variable configuration for different deployments.

**Epic 4: Observability and Logging**

- **\[5. Logging and Monitoring\]**
  - As a sysadmin, I want to use Graylog to collect, aggregate, and visualize logs from all components of the AI/NLP environment.

**Epic 5: Development and Evaluation Environment**

- **\[6. Development Environment\]**
  - As a developer, I want Ansible to set up my Ruby, Python, and Jupyter Labs environments automatically.

**Epic 6: Backup, Recovery, and Scalability**

- **\[12. Backup and Recovery\]**
  - As a sysadmin, I want to use Ansible to back up and restore both KVM virtual machines and Docker containers.
- **\[13. Load Balancing\]**
  - As a DevOps engineer, I want to use Ansible to configure load balancers (HAProxy, Nginx) for scalability and high availability.

**Epic 7: CI/CD and Automation**

- **\[14. Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)\]**
  - As a DevOps engineer, I want to integrate Ansible with CI/CD tools (Jenkins, GitLab CI) for automated testing and deployment pipelines.

**Epic 8: Documentation, Maintenance, and Community**

- **\[15. Documentation and Maintenance\]**
  - As a user, I need comprehensive documentation for each Ansible role and playbook.
  - As a sysadmin, I want a maintenance playbook for system updates and routine checks.
- **\[16. Performance Tuning\]**
  - As a sysadmin, I want Ansible roles to help me optimize system performance and adjust resource allocation.
- **\[17. Multi-environment Support\]**
  - As a DevOps engineer, I need Ansible to manage multiple environments (dev, staging, production) using environment-specific variables and playbooks.
- **\[Community Building\]**
  - As a potential contributor, I want clear contribution guidelines and a welcoming community to engage with.
- \[Medium Priority\] As a user, I need a comprehensive documentation site that explains the project's vision, components, and example workflows.
- \[Medium Priority\] As a potential contributor, I need clear contribution guidelines and processes to join the project.
- \[Medium Priority\] As a community member, I want to engage with the project through a blog, Twitter account, and Discord server.
- \[Low Priority\] As a stakeholder, I want to see pilot projects and case studies demonstrating the capabilities of the platform.
- \[Low Priority\] As a user, I want a roadmap outlining future enhancements and features.
- \[Low Priority\] As a developer, I want to ensure the codebase is regularly reviewed and optimized for efficiency.

Key Changes:

Sub-Epic: Introduced a sub-epic to group user stories related to the no-code evaluation platform.
Focus: Maintained the focus on the Ansible collection as the primary deliverable while integrating the subcomponent's backlog.
Priorities: Aligned the subcomponent's user story priorities with the overall backlog, ensuring high-level alignment.

This merged backlog provides a comprehensive roadmap for developing a powerful and flexible Ansible collection for AI/NLP system development, supporting both Docker and KVM deployments.
