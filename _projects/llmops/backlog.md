# Key Changes

- Sub-Epic: Introduced a sub-epic to group user stories related to the no-code evaluation platform.

- Focus: Maintained the focus on the Ansible collection as the primary deliverable while integrating the subcomponent's backlog.

- Priorities: Aligned the subcomponent's user story priorities with the overall backlog, ensuring high-level alignment.

This merged backlog provides a comprehensive roadmap for developing a powerful and flexible Ansible collection for AI/NLP system development, supporting both Docker and KVM deployments.
