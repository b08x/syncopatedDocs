> a striking illustration of a stylized crow perched on a mixing console. The crow, rendered in a dark gray hue, is facing towards the right side of the image. It's wearing a pair of headphones, suggesting it might be listening to music. The mixing console, also in dark magenta, is positioned on the left side of the image. In the background, there is linux terminal display with text that is monochrome, and it's positioned in the center of the screen. Above the crow, there's a text in white that reads "LAUDGPT". The text is clear and legible, standing out against the dark background. The crow and the mixing console positioned on opposite sides, creating a sense of symmetry. A creative representation of both old and new.
