## Purpose

This Ansible Collection is designed to streamline the setup and management of AI and natural language processing (NLP) development environments on local workstations. It provides roles and playbooks for deploying key components, setting up development tools, and managing DevOps tasks, all optimized for single-machine deployment with the potential to scale to distributed systems when needed. The collection includes support for various AI development platforms, LLM services, and specialized monitoring tools.
